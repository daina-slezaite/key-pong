# Key Pong
Key Pong is a single player paddle game built with HTML canvas via JavaScript. 

The objective of the game is to not let the ball fall down, always catching it with the paddle board. While catching the ball, you will end up catching piano keys as well (7 in total, C to H) which will play their sound and add a specific functionality for a certain amount of time to either the ball or the paddle or the background.
